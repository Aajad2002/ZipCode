The "Zip Code Information App - React" is a React application designed to enable users to input a postal code and retrieve location details using the https://api.zippopotam.us API. This application consists of at least two components: one for postal code input and another for displaying location information. Users can input a postal code, triggering an API call to fetch data, which includes country, state, and place name. The app gracefully handles errors and features a loading indicator while fetching data. It also offers an option to clear displayed information and boasts visually appealing styling via CSS or a CSS framework. Optionally, it can implement a Redux store to manage state.
